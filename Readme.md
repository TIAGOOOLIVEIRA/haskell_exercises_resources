# Haskell - My notes, ebook and exercises from the course "Learning Haskell Programming" [LinkedIn Learning]

This project was built and is maintained by Tiago Oliveira - [ti.olive@gmail.com](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tiagoliveira/).

I forked this project from [Hakim](https://github.com/osfameron) so I can exercise Haskell in step-by-step and put my notes there.

This is part of my effort to improve knowledge about Functional Programming. So now I know a little bit about a pure Functional Language - Haskell.

Know about Haskell will helps a lot my progress with Clojure and Scala as well.

Here the original project https://github.com/osfameron/words
